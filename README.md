Hello!

I made a Flask/Python web application for the video game Wynncraft, where you can check item and player data directly from the API. The source code is available in my project "WynnStats," so you can see how it works.

I'm currently working on "WSB Analysis," which will be an automated tool for gauging social media sentiment in specific financial tickers.

You can follow me on Twitter @Aspheterist.

Thank you!
